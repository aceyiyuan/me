<p>It is not unusual that many Chinese applications are prevalent only in the Chinese market. But if you understand both Chinese and other western countries cultural and make a comparison, you will find many Chinese applications actually win the competitions. One good example is Zhihu- a Chinese version Quora.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why I like it?</h2>

<p>I believe you will enjoy it too. People could find all kinds of issues on the platform from science to senses of humor. Everybody could post their answers and give a vote to the answered question. When you read here, you may question me, so what's its uniqueness? Well, just give me a few seconds, and I will let you know. Unlike other media, here I could get a lot of fun while at the same time learn knowledge. Sometimes, I prefer to label Zhihu as a combination of Quora and Reddit.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is the business model of Zhihu?</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zhihu">Crunchbase</a>, to date, Zhihu has raised fundings around $455M. Zhihu gets its profit from advertisements, private classroom, and premier membership payments. They have also opened a private message service. If one wants to get detailed information about something, the questioner will pay a certain amount of money and send an invitation to his interested person for an answer. For example, two months ago, a person sent me a message for a paid question.  He would like to know the background of an associate professor working in Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. That professor offered him  a researcher position.  But the questioner was not sure if he should take the offer or not. I turned down that offer. However, if I accepted that invitation, Zhihu would take 30% profit from the payment, and I should give my answer within 24 hours. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hot topics on Zhihu</h2>

<p>Like other media, a user could follow the topics discussed on Zhihu. The platform publishes daily its top pop list. Today the most popular one is "Is it possible that a person may never meet his/her ideal partner in life?" The last question on the top list is "How to make a USB working in a way that when you insert it into a computer, the computer will shut down immediately?" When you follow question like this, often you can read answers from specific field expert and become more knowledgable.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Social impact</h2>

<p>Nowadays, Zhihu is a powerful social communication tool in China, and it brings a lot of challenges to other social media such a WEIBO. Besides, most users on Zhihu are well educated. The user is not only limited to a person who physically lives in mainland China. One big user group is the engineers who are working in the Bay Area. On Zhihu they share their working and life experience. It is not rare when you see one guy shares his medical bill from the other side of the world. Many Ph.D. students have also commented that they usually explore Zhihu as the first task before starting their daily job. While, everything has two sides, and Zhihu is not the exception. The drawback of Zhihu is sometimes it brings you pressure as well. Imagine when you read a question like "Am I a loser because I was laid off and now I have only several million dollars net properties"? <p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The end</h2>

<p>To sum up, Zhihu brings me more happiness than anxieties. And many others may share the same opinion as well.  That 's why it is so popular among Chinese cultural populations. Hopefully, someday you will like it too! </p>
